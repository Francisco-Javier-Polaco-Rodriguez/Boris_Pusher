Here we have some classes that allows you to simulate N particles in a magnetic and electric field. There is no feedback between particles and EM fields. It is up to a parallelization, by the moment in Test_energy.py you can see how to do a thread of 8 cores with 5 particles simulation each core. It is a very simple exemple with a magnetic field of 1 tesla in the z axis.
